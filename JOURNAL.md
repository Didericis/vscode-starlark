This project started like [this lightbulb changing scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbSehcT19u0):

- Saw that my [tidbyt](https://tidbyt.com/) said "Airthings Credential Missing" for my airthings app
- Tried to remember how tidbyt worked/how I could push code up
- Went into a repo for a sample project I remember pushing to my tidbyt
- Saw that there wasn't any syntax highlighting for the "star" file
- Looked for an extension, only one I found has 1.5 stars and people saying it doesn't work (and I vaguely remember it not working)
- Started following instructions mentioned in [this blog post](https://mathspp.com/blog/til/vscode-extension-for-custom-syntax-highlighting) for creating syntax highlighting
- Saw that there was a "language support" option in the yeoman code generator
- Looked up what that was, read up on [the language server extension guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/language-server-extension-guide)
- Decided why not try and make one in an hour/see what happens
